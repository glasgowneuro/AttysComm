Python API for the Attys (www.attys.tech).

Attys is a lightweight bluetooth DAQ box which can measure
anything from temperature to ECG.




QUICK START GUIDE

# load the module
import pyattyscomm

# Gets the AttysScan class which scans for Attys via bluetooth
s = pyattyscomm.AttysScan()

# Scan for Attys
s.scan()

# get the 1st Attys
c = s.getAttysComm(0)

# if an attys has been found c points to it. Otherwise it's None.

# Start data acquisition in the background
c.start()

# Now we just read data at our convenience in a loop or timer or thread
# if data is available you can read it from the ringBuffer

while (not c.hasSampleAvilabale()):
    # do something else or nothing

# getting a sample (array of all Attys channels)
sample = c.getSampleFromBuffer()

# do something with the sample
print(sample)

# rinse and repeat: wait for next sample(s)
```

API DOCUMENTATION

The python API is identical to the C++ one:
https://github.com/glasgowneuro/AttysComm/tree/master/cpp

The header files AttysComm.h and AttysScan.h contain all
function definitions or just use the python help
system to get more info about it:

import pyattyscomm
help(pyattyscomm.AttysScan)
help(pyattyscomm.AttysComm)
